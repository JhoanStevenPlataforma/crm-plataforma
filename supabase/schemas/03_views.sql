-- The `nb_*` columns are scalar subqueries rather than a join + GROUP BY on
-- purpose. Aggregating over the join forced Postgres to group the entire table
-- before applying ORDER BY ... LIMIT, so opening page 1 of the list cost
-- ~580 ms on 20k companies / 100k deals. As a subquery the count is only
-- evaluated for the rows that survive the LIMIT: ~5 ms for the same page.
